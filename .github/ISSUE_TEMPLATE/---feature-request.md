Rugby 1.x is frozen for new feature requests. Please, open only requests with bug fixes.\
That's because there is [the new Rugby2.x version](https://github.com/swiftyfinch/Rugby/releases/tag/2.0.0b7) and it will be released soon.\
This new version isn't back-compatible with the first one and has an absolutely different code base.\
Also, Rugby2.x will be a closed code for the first time. And then I will open source after all preparations.\
Sorry for that freeze time, I hope we continue to develop this product together in the nearest future.
