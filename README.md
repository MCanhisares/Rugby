# Rugby üèà

<img src="https://github.com/swiftyfinch/Rugby/blob/main/Demo.gif" width="320"/>

In the current version `Rugby` cache all remote pods dependencies and remove them from the Pods project.\
Also, `Rugby` doesn't rebuild remote pods if their checksums don't change.

## Test Flight with Homebrew

```bash
brew tap swiftyfinch/Rugby https://github.com/swiftyfinch/Rugby.git
brew install swiftyfinch/Rugby/rugby
```

## Problems

- [ ] Doesn't rebuild parents pods after patch üòï \
Use `--rebuild` flag for temporary workaround.

## Maybe Roadmap

`-` Build for device\
`-` Speed up build with additional arguments\
`-` New command: Reduce & Focus
