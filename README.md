### `Motivation`

Working on a project with a huge amount of remote pods I had some troubles:\
`-` Slow and unnecessary indexing of remote pods targets, which implementation I rarely try to edit;\
`-` Redundant rebuild time, probably as a result of problems CocoaPods hooks or Xcode build system;\
`-` Freezing UI during navigation.

You can read üìñ [full story](https://swiftyfinch.github.io/en/2021-03-09-rugby-story/) on my blog.

### `Description`

`Rugby` is CLI tool that was developed to solve the above problems:\
`+` Cache all remote pods dependencies and remove their targets from the Pods project;\
`+` Rebuild only changed remote pods;\
`+` Remove unnecessary sources from a project and reduce project size;\
`+` Drop any unneeded targets with sources and resources by RegEx.

### ‚úàÔ∏è Quick start with [`Homebrew`](https://brew.sh)

```bash
# First install
$ brew tap swiftyfinch/Rugby https://github.com/swiftyfinch/Rugby.git
