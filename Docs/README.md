## Default command

By default **Rugby** runs the `plans` command if you have `.rugby/plans.yml` file.\
Otherwise `cache` command will be run.

## Log

If you run any command without `--verbose` flag you still can get verbosity output of the last **Rugby** run:

```bash
rugby log
```

## Doctor

If you encourage any problems, please call `rugby doctor` and follow suggestions.
